# Generate fake test data for Magento

MageFaker is a tool for creating a bunch of bogus customer accounts, products and orders on a Magento installation using realistic, yet fake, customer data.

###Â Installation

    git clone https://github.com/punkstar/magefaker.git ~/magefaker
    cd ~/magefaker
    composer install
    echo "alias magefaker=~/magefaker/bin/magefaker" >> ~/.zshrc

### Usage

Following command will create 1K fake products, 50K fake customer accounts, 3 fake orders (5 purchase items each) per customer & 20K fake guest orders for the Magento installation at `~/Sites/my/magento/root`.

    magefaker --magento ~/Sites/my/magento/root --customers 50000 3 5 --guestorders 20000 --products 1000 

### Note (Caveat)

For fake products only 'simple' product-types are supported. Other product types like 'configurable' and 'grouped' aren't supported because of the dependencies between parent and child products. 

For fake orders, assumption is that there are 'simple' products already on Magento. If not run something like the following command first (creates 2 fake 'simple' products): 

    magefaker --magento ~/Sites/my/magento/root --products 2
